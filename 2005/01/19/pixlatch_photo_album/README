Features:

Pixlatch is a very simple photo gallery generator.  
Pixlatch works on a heirarchy that looks like this:

rcw@blessed:~/public_html/pixlatch$ ls
pics1  pics2  pixlatch.pl  template.html

You just run it in the root directory and it parses out the images in 
the secondary directories.

====

Limitations:

Only reads in jpg
Only one level of recursion
