## Thanks to:
* [Dan Walters](http://walters.io) for [discovering the back door](https://web.archive.org/web/20131210152136/http://blog.danwalters.net/blog/2012/06/19/hacking-linksys-ea3500-firmware-for-ssh-access) to get SSH access.
* [Andrew Brampton](http://bramp.net) for [obtaining](https://blog.bramp.net/post/2012/01/22/obtaining-the-firmware-for-linksys-e4200v2/) and [dissecting](https://blog.bramp.net/post/2012/01/24/hacking-linksys-e4200v2-firmware/) the stock firmware.
* Hugh Daschback for writing and documenting much of the original Cisco GPL code and being kind enough to point me in the right direction every time I got stuck.
