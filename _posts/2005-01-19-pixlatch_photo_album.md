Pixlatch is a Perl script that generates a static photo gallery out of a directory full of oversized pictures (as produced by any modern digital camera).

## Features

* Thumbnail and scaled image generation via PerlMagick.
* Index generation
* Consistent scale viewing

## Philosophy

I wrote Pixlatch while waiting for a flight at [Denver International Airport](http://flydevner.com). I had been playing around with [curator](http://curator.sourceforge.net) and liked almost everything about it. Only one thing bothered me:

> Note that curator does not resize the large digital camera images to a viewable size automatically. We have planned a redesign which will allow to integrate this feature elegantly and generically.

In my opinion, resizing the obnoxious images was half the point of running a gallery. So with this in mind, I set about writing a cute little script that would generate scaled copies of the images and throw together some organizing html. I pretty much succeeded in about a half hour.
