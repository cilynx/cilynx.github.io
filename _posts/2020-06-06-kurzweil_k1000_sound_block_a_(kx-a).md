# Kurzweil K1000
## Sound Block A (KX-A)

Thanks for your purchase of KX-A, Sound Block A for the K1000!

KX-A adds many exciting sounds to the K1000, making it an even more versatile performance and composition tool.

Below is a list of the Soundfiles included in KX-A.  A Soundfile is the digitally-encoded information that distinguishes a flute from a drum from a bass, etc.  Refer to the Layer Parameter section of your manual for more information about the relationship between Soundfiles, Layer Parameters, and Programs.

On the other side of this card is as list of the Programs included with KX-A.  This list gives you the name and number of every KX-A Program, with a brief description of their effects and the Control Source used to achieve them.  Of course, you can edit these Programs and save them to RAM just like any other K1000 Program.
