### Unpacking & Inspection

The Kurzweil K1000 is delivered in a single corrugated cardboard shipping container.  Upon unpacking your K1000, immediately inspect it for shipping damage.  If it has been damaged in transit, you must place a claim with the carrier or with your Kurzweil dealer.  Kurzweil Music Systems assumes no responsibility for shipping damage.

The carton should contain:
* Your new K1000 keyboard
* Two foot pedal switches
* A wire music rack
* A three-prong AC power cable
* This _Musician's Guide_
* The [1000 Series Programming Reference](https://kurzweil.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/K1000ProgRef.pdf)
* A Warranty Registration Card

If any of these items is missing, contact your Kurzweil dealer.

When you first unpack your K1000, you'll notice that there is a strip of clear plastic tape covering the front-panel label plate.  Its function is to protect the plate from scratches when the unit is being packed.  You'll find that it peels off very easily.

We recommend that you save the shipping carton and protective inserts.  For carrying and shipping, they provide the best protection short of a custom-made road case.
