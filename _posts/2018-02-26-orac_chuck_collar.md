The nice stylized chuck collar on my ORAC was badly cracked when I got it.

There was a plain black one in the parts pile as well, but what fun is that?

I figured I'd try my luck with some [cyanoacrylate glue](http://amzn.to/2Fb2Tum) and [clamps](http://amzn.to/2F8CFZq).

Surprisingly, it worked pretty well.  The collar fits tight now and the glue appears to be holding.

Turn the collar around so the crack is in the back and no one will ever know.
