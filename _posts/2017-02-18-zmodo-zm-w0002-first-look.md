# <a name="overview"></a>zm-w0002

The zm-w0002 is a super-cheap outdoor security camera that you can [pick up on Amazon](http://amzn.to/2kwasCJ) in a 4-pack for $99.99.

![camera picture](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ecZB-nobL._SL300_.jpg)

I know what you're thinking... *Dude, you can't shake a stick at 4 weatherproof wifi cameras delivered to my door for $100.*  Unfortunately, you can.  These cameras are so cheap because Zmodo has removed every feature you might want to setup a *secure* locale *security* system and instead ships all of your data to their cloud service for later viewing on their proprietary mobile app.  Out of the box, these cameras will not work with *anything* other than the proprietary kitsch they're bundled with.

Luckily, it's powered by the popular and well documented HiSilicon Hi3518 SoC ([Datasheet](/assets/Hi3518-Datasheet.pdf), [User Guide](/assets/Hi3518-UserGuide.pdf)).

# <a name="setup_services"></a>Setup Services

According to the [Quick Start Guide](http://support.zmodo.com/assets/media/quick_user_guide_en/ZM-W0002-4_quick_guide.pdf), you're supposed to power up your cameras, then download the [MeShare App](http://surveillance.zmodo.com/meshare-app) ([iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/meshare/id977910819?mt=8), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.meshare&hl=en)) which will walk you through creating a [MeShare Account](https://user.meshare.com/user/login), transferring you network creds to your camera(s), and viewing your live streams on your phone.  There's no way I'm installing an app on my phone to access a "free" amorphous cloud service, nor am I sending my network creds or survalence data to said amorphous cloud service in the first place.  So, let's see what's really going on.

While in setup mode, the camera broadcasts a wifi hotspot called `ZMD_SAP`.  It assigns itself `192.168.10.1` and runs a DHCP server handing out addresses in the `192.168.10.2-100` range.  Connecting a machine to the network and scanning the camera gives the following:

```
rcw@antec:~$ nmap -A -T4 192.168.10.1

Starting Nmap 7.40 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2017-02-14 18:04 PST

```

I haven't figured out what's going on with `4444` yet and we'll talk about `8000` [later](#8000).  For now, let's focus on the two httpd servers running on `8086` and `8087`.

## <a name="8086"></a>:8086

Pulling up `192.168.10.1:8086` in a browser gives us a tidy little web form, with the requisite spelling error on the `Concle` button. 

![8086-form](/assets/8b6df1c2-f55b-11e6-867a-9fa671c7daf8.png)

It looks like it's asking for numerical input, so I figured I'd feed it some non-numeric strings and see what happens.

![8086-success](/assets/8b6f1994-f55b-11e6-90cd-22f03a431325.png)

Success!  We'll see later that this form updates a conf file on the filesystem with what appears to be no validation whatsoever.  I need to do a little exploring here to see if I can exploit this form to start `telnetd` (which is available on the system, just not running by default) and avoid tearing the rest of my cameras apart to access their serial consoles.

## <a name="8087"></a>:8087

Pulling `192.168.10.1:8087` in a brower gives us another tidy little web form, once again with the `Concle` button.

![8087-form](/assets/8b70befc-f55b-11e6-8df5-25a59d7ee49a.png)

Now this looks more interesting.  I setup a little lab network without any uplink and attempted to connect.  I'm not sure what `USERID` or `CLIENT_COUNT` are about, but I figured the lack of input validation wouldn't care if I left them blank.

![8087-failure](/assets/8b72ad66-f55b-11e6-92b9-8290448dc9fc.png)

Surprise! It failed.  Sad.  I guess we need some values after all.  Let's try `foo` and `bar` as before.

![8087-success](/assets/8b70292e-f55b-11e6-939d-ad292d2a04dd.png)

Success!  I haven't yet found which files this updates, but at this point, the camera will stop broadcasting `ZMD_SAP` and will join your provided network, asking for an address over DHCP.  Keep in mind that these cameras only have 2.4GHz radios ([RTL8188EUS](http://www.realtek.com/search/default.aspx?keyword=rtl8188) to be exact), so they will not see your 5GHz networks.  If all went well and it successfully joined your network, the camera will now switch from setup mode to production mode.

# <a name="production_services"></a>Production Services

Let's start by scanning the camera from a machine on the same lab network:
```
rcw@burner:~/Projects/zmodo$ nmap 192.168.1.170

Starting Nmap 7.40 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2017-02-14 18:40 PST

/assets/zm-w0002-tcp open  http-alt

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.65 seconds
rcw@burner:~/Projects/zmodo$ 
```
Sad.  It looks like our httpd servers went away.  I guess we'll have to dig further into what we do have.  

## <a name="8000"></a>:8000

Thanks to the [Zmodo - Local Controller project over on Hackaday](https://hackaday.io/project/8642-zmodo-local-controller), we know that most Zmodo cameras respond to commands that look vaguely like `55 55 aa aa 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 50`.  I created an [ugly little perl script](/assets/zm-w0002-scan.pl) to scan the last two bytes, sending every possible combination and listening for responses.  I noticed that the middle `00` bytes don't need to be `00`, but I haven't figured out what they really are yet, so I'm leaving them alone in this scan.  Every response starts with a header very similar to the command sent.  Sometimes some of the `00` are changed, but the `55 55 aa aa` is always there and the last two bytes are always the same as the command.  Here's a very incomplete list of commands and responses:

|Command|Response|Bin|
|---|---|---|
|00 91|Looks like a config dump.  Has some directory names as well as the wifi ssid, channel, and password.  Also contains whatever it is that 00 9c sets.|[0091.bin](/assets/zm-w0002-0091.bin)|
|00 98|Model number, something that looks like a UID, a 10-digit identifier that is also physically screened on the bord, and two version strings.|[0098.bin](/assets/zm-w0002-0098.bin)|
|00 99|Binary I haven't figured out yet.  Contains whatever 00 9c sets|[0099.bin](/assets/zm-w0002-0099.bin)|
|00 9c|Sets *something*.  [This guy](https://hackaday.io/project/8642-zmodo-local-controller/discussion-54904) thinks it's the MAC address, but I've been unable to confirm.||
|01 9c|Returns whatever was set by 00 9c||
|11 90|Some version strings||
|12 a1|Wifi site survey||
|36 96|An AES key stored in a file named "key" on the filesystem.  A quick google search for the key on my test device didn't turn up any hits, so it may be unique per device.  I'll update this section once I get inside another camera.||

# <a name="physical_teardown"></a>Physical Teardown

Poking at the network is fun and all, but let's tear this thing apart...

![teardown1](/assets/3ca45254-f5d6-11e6-8f87-9cbe8cb8dba9.jpg)

Yup, that's a desiccant pouch like you find in beef jerky stuffed in there.  I guess that's one way to keep things dry.

![teardown2](/assets/3ca3a4d0-f5d6-11e6-98a3-5aa49aef1d20.jpg)

I haven't investigated the IR LEDs much yet.  Will update here if I ever get that far.

![teardown3](/assets/3ca3f05c-f5d6-11e6-922a-4362ea96ad8a.jpg)

The main camera body, still in one piece.

![teardown4](/assets/3ca4100a-f5d6-11e6-8446-28648ce1549f.jpg)

Here's the fun side of the board.  A few points of note:
- The three pads in the upper middle are an active RS232 port.
- The chip in the upper right is a RTL8188EUS 2.4GHz radio.
- The gray lead right next to the radio is its antenna.
- The empty headers in the picture are where the IR LEDs hook up.
- There's a 4-pin USB header, but only power and ground are connected.  I haven't yet tried connecting the data lines to see if it'll talk to an outside computer.
- The screws in the middle hold the lens assembly to the board.
- The sloppily installed ceramic heatsink is covering the Hi3518 SoC.

![teardown5](/assets/3ca52544-f5d6-11e6-880e-3e6722a41488.jpg)

Here, we can see the surface-mounted imager under the lens assembly.  Also note `79990304 REV3.0` screened on the board.  We get that number back from a `00 98` request as well.

![teardown6](/assets/3ca6bdb4-f5d6-11e6-9554-9362ba1cbf40.jpg)

You can adjust the focus of the lens by screwing it into or out of its housing.  The spring just keeps everything tight.

![teardown7](/assets/3cb5e492-f5d6-11e6-9488-dcdbf028afd8.jpg)

I didn't feel like soldering anything to the board in that tiny space, so I just bent a couple [female to male jumper wires](http://amzn.to/2lW25jO) 90-degrees and bread tied them to the board.  I was out of rubber bands.  Don't judge.  The other end is a [cheap CP2102 USB<->RS232 adaptor](http://amzn.to/2luLl27) feeding [GtkTerm](https://fedorahosted.org/gtkterm/) `115200-8-N-1`.

Enough fooling around with what's already there.  Let's run our own code on this thing.
## <a name="toolchain_setup"></a> Toolchain Setup
While there are lots of folks out there talking about the Hi3518 SDK, actually finding a copy of it isn't so easy.  I'm not sure what the deal is.  All of the [official links from HiSilicon](http://www.hisilicon.com/products/digital.html) are dead, so I don't know if they would have contained the SDK or not.  The only thing I could find out there was [one guy](http://yumichan.net/linux/how-to-run-a-shell-script-at-startup-on-hisilicons-hi3518/) who says that he got the SDK along with the Hi3518 board when he ordered one.  At any rate, you can [get the SDK here](https://mega.co.nz/#!69tXHCAD!spJmcKzH3WUmOOyTMVxIc07N4m6Bu8m3ziDhURaKjgM), but be warned, it's an anonymous MEGA upload.  I didn't do the upload, but it is the SDK that I'm using.  I cannot vouch for the cleanlyness / health of the SDK and it does ask for root access (to access `/opt`) as part of the install.  I would advise installing the SDK in a dedicated / disposable VM, especially if you get it from the MEGA link.

At any rate, setting up a toolchain is fairly straightforward, but I'm lazy, so I googled around and found [Nemon's IPR1631X page](http://nemon.org/ipcam-ipr1631x/#SDK) where he outlines the steps.  Continuing in my laziness, I wrote a little [bash script](/assets/zm-w0002-setup_toolchain.sh) to setup the toolchain for me.  The whole thing should run with no errors and at the end, you'll have the `arm-hisiv100-linux` toolchain available in your `$PATH`.

## <a name="dropbear"></a> Dropbear (SSH)

Out-of-the-box, we already have `telnetd` and `ftpd` available and we're living on a local lab network, so `dropbear` is a little unnecessary, however, I'm already pretty familiar with cross-compiling it from [previous](/candyhouse) [projects](http://github.com/cilynx/DGND3700v2) and it's a great test to see if the toolchain is working.  Of course I put together a little [bash script](/assets/zm-w0002-build_dropbear.sh) to build `dropbear` just the way I like it.  After running the script, you'll find a `dropbearmulti` binary in `dropbear-2016.74/` which will run nicely on the camera.
