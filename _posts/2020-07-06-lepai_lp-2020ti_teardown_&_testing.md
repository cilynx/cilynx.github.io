Parts-Express [claims](https://youtu.be/haBAMl22x88) this one is the "one true successor" to the original [Lepai LP-2020A+]({% post_url 2020-06-30-lepai_lp-2020a+_teardown_&_testing %}). They say that they designed this amp around the [Texas Instruments TPA3118](/assets/TPA3118D2.pdf) because the [Tripath TA2020](/assets/Tripath TA2020-020.pdf) has become hard for them to source. Further, they claim the new 2020TI sounds "cleaner" and is more powerful than the original [2020A+]({% post_url 2020-06-30-lepai_lp-2020a+_teardown_&_testing %}) with the 2020TI putting out 14W@1%THD as compared to 7W@1%THD for the 2020A+ when running on the same 12V@3A (36W) power supply.

To my ear, however, this new offering is inferior to its predecessor.  First off, the TI amp appears to be less efficient.  You have to turn it up higher to get the same volume and maximum output on the TI is lower than from the Tripath.  Second, at the risk of sounding like an audiophile knob, the TI seems to convey less presence and soul.

This amp doesn't sound bad, but to about the same degree that the [Kinter K2020A+]({% post_url 2020-07-04-kinter_k2020a+_teardown_&_testing %}) sounds better than the [Lepai LP-2020A+]({% post_url 2020-06-30-lepai_lp-2020a+_teardown_&_testing %}), this one sounds worse.  Considering this is the most expensive of the amps on my list, I don't see any reason for anyone else to buy one as long as the [Kinter K2020A+]({% post_url 2020-07-04-kinter_k2020a+_teardown_&_testing %}) and [Lvpin LP-2020A+]({% post_url 2018-01-27-mini_hifi_bakeoff %}#Lvpin LP-2020A+) are available.
